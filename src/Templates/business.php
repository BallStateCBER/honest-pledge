<p>
    As a business owner in Muncie/Delaware County I wish to help end corruption in local government and to create an 
    environment of trust, where my business can thrive and grow.
</p>

<p>
    I understand that:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Corruption lessons the trust between citizens, local businesses and government</li>
    <li>Corruption reduces the quality of public services my business receives from the city/county</li>
    <li>Corruption damages my companyâ€™s ability to thrive and grow</li>
    <li>Corruption is counter to the fundamental levels of trust needed for a successful economy</li>
</ul>

<p>
    I pledge to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>To immediately report to legal authorities any case of corruption I observe</li>
    <li>To educate myself and my employees on what corrupt practices are and how they affect my business</li>
    <li>To display the anti-corruption logo in my business</li>
</ul>

<p>
    As a Citizen of Muncie/Delaware County I wish to help end corruption in local government and to create an
    environment of trust between citizens and their government.
</p>

<p>
    I understand that:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Corruption lessens trust in local government</li>
    <li>Corruption poisons civil discourse</li>
    <li>Corruption damages our local economy</li>
    <li>Corruption is a threat to the wellbeing of me, my neighbors and my community</li>
</ul>

<p>
    So I pledge to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>To speak up against corruption</li>
    <li>To educate myself on what corrupt practices are and how they affect my family and neighbors</li>
    <li>To vote for honest candidates</li>
</ul>
